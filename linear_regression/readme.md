# Introduction
This directory contains code for implementing Linear Regression using Python. The code demonstrates how to create a simple linear regression model, train it on a dataset, and make predictions.
# Files Structure
`utils.py`: Contains utility functions for data preprocessing and Linear Regression class.<br>
`main.ipynb` : Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use the Linear Regression class to fit a model and make predictions.
# Requirements
I built this model from scratch using Python. The code does not require any external libraries, only some libraries like NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.
# Usage
To use the Linear Regression implementation, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open the `main.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells to see how the Linear Regression model is created, trained, and used for predictions.
