# Introduction
This directory contains the code for a logistic regression model. The model is trained on a dataset and evaluated for its performance.
# Directory Structure
`utils.py`: Contains utility functions for data preprocessing and the Logistic Regression class.<br>
`main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use the Logistic Regression class to fit a model and make predictions.
# Requirements
I built this model from scratch using Python. The code does not require any external libraries, only some libraries like NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.
# Usage
To use the Logistic Regression implementation, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open the `main.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells to see how the Logistic Regression model is created, trained, and used for predictions.
