# Introduction 
In this project, I built my own softmax regression model from scratch using NumPy. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of images of handwritten digits. The goal is to classify these images into one of the ten digit classes (0-9).

The model uses the softmax function to compute probabilities for each class and the cross-entropy loss function to measure the performance of the model. The training process involves updating the model parameters using gradient descent.
