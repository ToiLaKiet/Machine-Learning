# Introduction 
In this project, I built my own softmax regression model from scratch using NumPy. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of images of handwritten digits. The goal is to classify these images into one of the ten digit classes (0-9).
# Directory Structure
`utils.py`: Contains utility functions for data preprocessing and the Softmax Regression class.<br>
`main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use the Softmax Regression class to fit a model and make predictions.
# Requirements
I built this model from scratch using Python. The code does not require any external libraries, only some libraries like NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.
# Usage
To use the Softmax Regression implementation, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open the `main.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells to see how the Softmax Regression model is created, trained, and used for predictions.
